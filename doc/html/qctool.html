				<p>
					QCTOOL is a command-line utility program for basic quality control of gwas datasets.
					It supports the same <a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/%7Emarchini/software/gwas/file_format_new.html">file formats</a>
					used by the <a href="http://www.wtccc.org.uk/">WTCCC studies</a>, as well as the binary file format
					described <a href="http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/bgen_format.html">here</a>,
					and is designed to work seamlessly with
					<a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/%7Emarchini/software/gwas/gwas.html">SNPTEST and related tools</a>.
					QCTOOL computes per-sample and per-SNP summary statistics, and uses these to filter out samples and SNPs
					from the dataset (either by removing them from the files or by writing exclusion lists).
				</p>
				<p>
					QCTOOL can be used to :
					<ul>
						<li>
							Calculate per-sample and per-SNP summary statistics;
						</li>
						<li>
							Filter out samples and SNPs, either by creating new data files or by creating exclusion lists.
						</li>
						<li>
							Populate sample files with missingness and heterozygosity information;
						</li>
						<li>
							Convert files between different GEN file formats.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					QCTOOL has a number of features designed to make it easy to use :
					<ul>
						<li>
							Automatically run across the whole genome (using the chromosomal wildcard character '#' to find matching files)
						</li>
						<li>
							Robust file reading and careful error checking - QCTOOL will tell you if it thinks you are doing something wrong.
						</li>
						<li>
							Informative output and progress bars giving an estimate of remaining runtime.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>
				QCTOOL works according to the schematic on the right.
				A detailed list of options is given by the command <pre>
$ qctool -help
				</pre>
				which produces <a href="qctool_help.txt">this output</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Qctool works with the following per-sample summary statistics, calculated using the -sample-stats option:
					<dl>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold ;">Missingness</dt>
						<dd>the total proportion of missing genotype data for this sample across all SNPs.
							This is the sum of the three genotype probabilities for the sample across all SNPs,
							divided by the total number of SNPs.  A large missing data proportion might be due, for example, to
							a badly-prepared sample.  You can filter on missingness using the
							-sample-missing-rate option.
						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold ;">Heterozygosity</dt>
						<dd>This is the sum of heterozygote call probabilities across all SNPs
							divided by the total number of SNPs.  A high value of heterozygosity might indicate, for example, that
							the DNA from this sample was been accidentally mixed with another sample during processing; a low value
							might indicate a higher degree of relatedness than expected among the ancestors of the
							individual.  You can filter on heterozygosity using the -heterozygosity option.
						</dd>
					</dl>
					You can filter samples based on these summary statistics, or using lists of sample ids.
				</p>
				<p>
					Qctool works with the following per-SNP summary statistics:
					<dl>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold ;">
							Missingness
						</dt>
						<dd> The proportion of missing genotype data across all samples for the SNP.
							A high value indicates that the SNP is not well called.  You can filter these SNPs
							out using the -snp-missing-rate option.
						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold ;">
							Minor allele frequency
						</dt>
						<dd>
							The estimated frequency of the less common allele.  The -maf option can be used to retain only SNPs within
							a given range of minor allele frequencies.
						</dd>
						<dt style="font-weight: bold ;">Information</dt>
						<dd>
 							A measure of much statistical information the genotypes provide about the allele frequency,
							ranging from 0 (least information) to 1 (most information).
							Use the -info option to filter on this statistic.
						</dd>
					</dl>
					You can filter out SNPs based on these summary statistics, on position, or based on the SNP ids.
				</p>
				<p>
					In general, qctool tries to warn you if it thinks you are doing something wrong.
					In these cases you can override qctool using the -force option.
